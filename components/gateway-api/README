This "component" manages the [Gateway API] CRD installation on
Toolforge. It is a bit non-standard as the CRDs are not available as a
Helm chart, instead the upstream manifests are applied directly with
`kubectl apply`.

To update the manifests, use the utils/upgrade_gateway_api.sh script in
the root of this repository, for example:
$ utils/upgrade_gateway_api.sh 1.4.1
